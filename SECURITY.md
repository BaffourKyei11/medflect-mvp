# Medflect AI - Cybersecurity Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive cybersecurity measures implemented in the Medflect AI healthcare platform. The system follows strict cybersecurity principles and procedures to ensure the protection of sensitive patient data, secure AI interactions, and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Security Model

The Medflect AI platform implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

- **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS encryption, CORS policies, rate limiting
- **Application Security**: Input validation, output sanitization, authentication, authorization
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure key management
- **AI Security**: Prompt injection protection, output validation, audit logging
- **Infrastructure Security**: Container security, secure deployment practices

### 2. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT-Based Authentication
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token refresh mechanisms
- Secure token storage and transmission

#### Role Hierarchy
```
Admin → Doctor → Nurse → Patient
```

#### Access Control Matrix
| Resource | Admin | Doctor | Nurse | Patient |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Patient Data | Full | Assigned | Assigned | Own |
| AI Features | Full | Full | Limited | None |
| System Config | Full | None | None | None |
| Audit Logs | Full | None | None | None |

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key derivation with PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations)

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: General information, non-sensitive metadata
- **Internal**: Operational data, system logs
- **Confidential**: Patient health information, user credentials
- **Restricted**: API keys, private keys, encryption keys

#### Data Retention
- Patient data: Retained according to healthcare regulations
- Audit logs: 365 days minimum retention
- AI interactions: 90 days for analysis, then anonymized
- System logs: 30 days for operational purposes

X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### 3. Content Security Policy

#### CSP Directives
```javascript
{
  defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
  styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
  scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
  imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:", "blob:"],
  fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
  connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.groq.com", "http://91.108.112.45:4000"],
